## This is my 3rd Year University project code, as it was too large to submit via the online portal

The dataset is already pre-formatted and as such no changes need to be made to it. Furthermore, running each training script should work when set to `num_epochs` = 1000. Training for 1000 epochs is the same as done in the report, however can take a long time. Hence, the video demonstration [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7fM5RAPuqw) does not show training in progress.

This code does leverage the CUDA framework for use on my own graphics card and as such, you may need to set that up for yourself.
